# Coding_demo
Hello! I am Zhi-Xiu. Currently, I work as an engineer at a semiconductor plant. 
I am also strongly interested in programming languages and am currently looking for **IT-related** or **software-related** job opportunities. 
This repository holds my programming projects done during the period of the stanCode course, along with my coding practice from LeetCode.
